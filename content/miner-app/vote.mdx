Based on your miner rewards, you are now able to vote for community-developed exchange connectors to be included into the core Hummingbot code base in the next release. For more information, see our blog for the lastest [governance proposal](https://hummingbot.io/blog/tag/governance).

## Voting Methodology

- Votes per miner: the total votes each miner has is based on the total amount of mining rewards they have earned in the most recent weekly reward period. For example, a miner who earned \$100 in the rewards period will have 100 votes.
- Reward amounts will be rounded up to the nearest whole vote: a miner who earned $0.01 of rewards is still entitled to 1 full vote, while a miner who earned $1.01 will have 2 votes, and so on. This allows for any miner who has earned any amount of rewards to have a minimum of 1 vote.
