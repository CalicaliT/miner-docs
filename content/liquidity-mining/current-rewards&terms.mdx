## Additional liquidity mining campaign terms

Qualified participants will be eligible to receive compensation in accordance with each liquidity mining campaign’s schedule of Liquidity Mining Payments, which will be based on each participant’s trading activity (in particular, orders placed and their sizes and spreads) in the tokens subject to the liquidity mining campaign.

**Wallet address**  
Participants must enter a valid wallet address applicable for the campaign that they are participating in. Wallet address are use for receiving payouts only, you do not need deposit assets into or trade using this wallet.  
For more details on how to obtain wallet address and its requiremets, please refer to our docs on [Liquidity Mining FAQs](/resources/liquidity-mining/)

> **Warning:** CoinAlpha does not take any responsibility and will not reimburse for any loss of funds due to a participant submitting an incorrect or invalid wallet address.

> **Important:** Orders outstanding for more than 30 minutes not counted for rewards

Work on removing this limit is in progress, you can read more about it in our [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hummingbot/comments/hz5xv3/tracking_rewards_for_orders_longer_than_30m/).

> **Tip:** To ensure that orders do not stay outstanding for longer than 30 minutes, Hummingbot users should disable [order refresh tolerance](/strategies/order-refresh-tolerance/).

**Minimum reward payout amount**

Due to the recent surge in Ethereum gas price, Hummingbot will impose a **\$50.00** minimum on the weekly payout **for payments on the Ethereum blockchain (currently USDT and RLC)**, starting with the next scheduled payout on September 18th (UTC).

For miners who earn < \$50 within one week, their rewards will be accrued and rolled over to the next period, read more in this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hummingbot/comments/ip4mc3/announcement_raising_minimum_payment_to_50/).
