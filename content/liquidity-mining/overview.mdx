Liquidity mining is a community-based, data-driven approach to market making, in which a token issuer or exchange can reward a pool of miners to provide liquidity for a specified token.

- **Open - Anyone can participate\***
- **Real time - Track your earnings every minute**
- **Non-custodial - We can't access your tokens**

You earn rewards by running a market making bot that maintains orders on exchange order books. How much reward you earn depends on:

- The amount of your orders
- The spread (distance to the mid price) of your orders
- How long you maintain your orders on the order book
- The amount of your orders
- The spread (distance to the mid price) of your orders
- How long you maintain your orders on the order book
