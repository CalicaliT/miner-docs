If you have mulitple bots running and participating in liquidity mining, each miner will be represented by a different color. Move your cursor over the graph and a pop-up box is displayed with the individual miner bot rewards per snapshot by the min.

## Snapshots Rewards Per Min

In each weekly epoch, the lump-sum weekly reward is distributed equally across each minute within that epoch. For each minute, a random snapshot is taken from within that minute to be used for calculating reward allocations.

For each snapshot, half the reward is allocated to the bid-side of the order book, and the other half is allocated to the ask side of the order book. We mandate this 50/50 split in order to deter participants from using our system to manipulate price in one direction or another. If there are no eligible orders submitted for a specific snapshot, the amount of rewards allocated for that snapshot will roll over and be added to the reward amount for the subsequent snapshot.

!!! note "Earning rewards in mulitple markets"
You can run different instances of Hummingbot or your own software to earn rewards in multiple markets simultaneously. And the reward allocations for each market are calculated independently, so your earnings in one market won't affect other markets.
